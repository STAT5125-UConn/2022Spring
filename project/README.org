*Topic Sign Up Link*: https://classroom.github.com/a/MWhxJSvT

This project consists of two parts: an oral presentation and a written
report. You may work alone or work with a partner on the project. If you work
with a partner, the two students should give the oral presentation together. The
written report and all source codes should be managed on github.com through the
[[https://classroom.github.com/a/1e3Frc21][submission link]]. *The written report is due on TBA*.

When you accept the invitation, you can create a new team if you work along or
if you are the first in your team to accept the link, or you can join an
existing team if your partner has created a team.

* Project interactions
Give other all other students "Read" access to your project repo. Although not
required, everyone is requested to provide feedback on other teams' work by
creating issues or pull requests because this will be helpful for the each team to improve their
work.

Every student must assign an overall score for each team (scale 1-10) except
your own team. The score should take into account the presentation and the writing materials in the project repo. Fill the file [[./ProjectScore.md][ProjectScore]] with your scores for all other teams and send it to <haiying.wang@uconn.edu> by 8pm Sunday, May 1, 2022.

*If you do not send me the filled form by May 1, you will lose this portion of the credits; if the team did not give access to any other students, the ream will lose the corresponding credits.*
