This project consists of two parts: an oral presentation and a written
report. You may work alone or work with a partner on the project. If you work
with a partner, the two students should give the oral presentation together. The
written report and all source codes should be managed on github.com through the
submission link (TBA). *The written report is due on TBA*.

# When you accept the invitation, you can create a new team if you work along or
# if you are the first on in your team to accept the link, or you can join an
# existing team if your partner has created a team.

# The length of the oral presentation will be announced after the number of teams
# are set.
