# Project Scores

Each student needs to assign an overall score for each team (scale 1-10) except
your own team. The score should take into account the presentation and the writing materials in the project repo. Send this file with your scores to <haiying.wang@uconn.edu> by 8pm Sunday, May 1, 2022.
