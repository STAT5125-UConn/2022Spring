** Elevator waiting time
Mr. Smith works on the 13th floor of a 15 floor building. The only elevator
moves continuously through floors 1, 2, . . . 14, 15, 14, . . . 2, 1, 2, . . . ,
except that it stops on a floor on which the button has been pressed. Assume
that time spent loading and unloading passengers is very small compared to the
travelling time.  Mr.~Smith complains that at 5pm, when he wants to go home, the
elevator almost always goes up when it stops on his floor. What is the
explanation?

** Intransitive Dice
We know that in general if A>B and B>C then A>C. However, this may not be
the case in the word of probability.

Consider three dice with different sides numbers:

- Die A has sides 2, 2, 4, 4, 9, 9.
- Die B has sides 1, 1, 6, 6, 8, 8.
- Die C has sides 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7.

To play a game using dice A and B, you can chose which die to roll and your
opponent rolls the other. The one who tolls a larger number wins. Which die do
you want to choose?

- Between A and B?
- Between B and C?
- Between C and A?

** Banach Match Problem
A pipe smoker carries one box of matches in his left pocket and one box in his
right. Initially, each box contains $n=100$ matches. If he needs a match, the
smoker is equally likely to choose either pocket. What is the probability for
the number of matches in the other box to be $m=3$ when he ﬁrst discovers that
one box is empty?

What is the average number of matches left in the other box when the smoker ﬁrst
discovers that one box is empty?
** Two Child Problem
Consider the following two problems:

- Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the
  probability that both children are girls?
- Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a girl. What is the
  probability that both children are girls?

** Fair Division
  Tom and Jerry, each put 30 dollar in a jackpot to start a
  game. Suppose that they have equal chance to win and the one who
  wins three times takes all the 60 dollars. Now, Tom has won twice
  and Jerry has won once, but then something happens and the game must
  be stopped. How should they split the 60 dollars according their
  probabilities of winning if the game was finished.

** Bertrand's Box
There are three boxes, one contains two gold coins, one contains two
silver coins, and one contains a gold coin and a silver coin.
A box is selected at random and a coin is taken from that box at random. If the
coin is a gold coin, what is the probability that the other coin in that box is
also a gold coin.

** Canadian lottery
  Canadian lottery ofﬁcials learned the importance
of careful counting the hard way when they decided to give back
some unclaimed prize money that had accumulated. They purchased 500 automobiles as bonus prizes and programmed a computer to determine the winners by randomly selecting 500 numbers
from their list of 2.4 million subscriber numbers. The ofﬁcials published the unsorted list of 500 winning numbers, promising an automobile for each number listed. To their embarrassment, one
individual claimed (rightly) that he had won two cars. The ofﬁcials
were ﬂabbergasted -- with over 2 million numbers to choose from,
how could the computer have randomly chosen the same number
twice? Was there a fault in their program?

** Birthday Problem
Suppose that a room contains 23 people. What is the probability that
at least two of them have a common birthday? Assuming that each year has 365
days, this probability seems very small, but it is actually about
0.5. What is the probability that some one in that room has the same
birthday as yours?

# \pause \vspace{.21cm}
The probability of a common birthday is surprisingly larger:
| $n$, number of people |    4 |   16 |   23 |   32 |   40 |   56 |
| Pr(common birthday)   | .016 | .284 | .507 | .753 | .891 | .988 |
# \pause
The probability that someone's birthday is the same as yours is quite small. We need 253 random selected people to have it to be 0.5.

| $n$   |     4 |    16 |    23 |    32 |    40 |    56 |   252 |   253 |
| $\Pr$ | 0.011 | 0.043 | 0.061 | 0.084 | 0.104 | 0.142 | 0.499 | 0.500 |

** Henry’s Choice
Henry has been caught stealing cattle, and is brought into town for justice. The
judge is his ex-wife Gretchen, who wants to show him some sympathy, but the law
clearly calls for two shots to be taken at Henry from close range. To make
things a little better for Henry, Gretchen tells him she will place two bullets
into a six-chambered revolver in successive order. She will spin the chamber,
close it, and take one shot. If Henry is still alive, she will then either take
another shot, or spin the chamber again before shooting.

Henry is a bit incredulous that his own ex-wife would carry out the punishment,
and a bit sad that she was always such a rule follower. He steels himself as
Gretchen loads the chambers, spins the revolver, and pulls the trigger. Whew! It
was blank. Then Gretchen asks, "Do you want me to pull the trigger again, or
should I spin the chamber a second time before pulling the trigger?" What
should Henry choose?

** Monty Hall problem
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1,
and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3,
which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it
to your advantage to switch your choice?

** 100 prisoners problem
In a prison, there are 100 death row prisoners who are numbered from 1
to 100, and there is a room with 100 drawers labeled from 1 to 100.
The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed
drawer and offers a last chance. The prisoners enter the room, one
after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any
order. The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this
search, every prisoner finds his number in one of the drawers, all
prisoners are pardoned. If some prisoner does not find his number, all
prisoners die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the
prisoners may discuss strategy, but they cannot communicate once the
first prisoner enters the room.

** 100 prisoners problem
The situation is hopeless if every prisoner selects 50 drawers at
random. The probability that a single prisoner finds his number is
0.5, so the probability that all prisoners find their numbers is
$0.5^{100} = 7.89\times10^{-31}\approx0$.

However, a better strategy
gives the prisoners more than 0.30 probability to survive.
Here is the strategy:

- Each prisoner first opens the drawer with his own number.
- If this drawer contains his number he is done and was
  successful.
- Otherwise, the drawer contains the number of another prisoner
  and he next opens the drawer with this number.
- The prisoner repeats steps 2 and 3 until he finds his own number
  or has opened 50 drawers.
