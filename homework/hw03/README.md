Be sure to set the random seed in your codes so that your results are reproducible.

1. A King offers a death row prisoner a chance to live by playing a simple
   game. He gives 50 black marbles, 50 white marbles, and 2 empty bowls to the
   prisoner. The King asks the prisoner to divide these 100 marbles into these 2
   bowls in any way as long as all the marbles are used. He will then blindfold
   the prisoner and mix the bowls around. After that, the prisoner can choose one
   bowl and pick one marble randomly.  If the marble is white the prisoner will
   live, but if the marble is black the prisoner will die. Use simulation to find
   the probability of living for the following ways of dividing.
   
   1. Put the 50 white balls in one bowl and the 50 black balls in another bowl.
   2. Put one white ball in one bowl and the other 99 bowl balls in another bowl. 

2. Three players enter a room and a red or blue hat is placed on each
   person's head.  The color of each hat is determined by an independent coin
   toss. No communication of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy
   session before the game begins.  Once they have had a chance to look at the
   other hats but not their own, the players must simultaneously guess the
   color of their own hats or pass. The puzzle is to find a group strategy that
   maximizes the probability that at least one person guesses correctly and
   no-one guesses incorrectly. Use simulation to answer the following questions.
   
   1. One strategy is for the group to agree that one person should guess and
      the others pass. What is the probability of success?
   2. Here is another strategy. For each person, guess the color he/she does
      not see if he/she see same colors, and pass is he/she sees different
      colors. What is the probability of success?

3. Find the probability that exactly one person wins two cars for the Canadian lottery example in [note04](../../notes/note04_simulation/note04.org). Specifically, assume that there are 2.4 million subscriber numbers and 500 numbers are randomly selected with replacement.

- Give another two students (to be specified in the FeedbackList.md) access to your submission repository so that they can push their feedback to it.

- Fill the feedback forms on another two students' work and push the forms to their homework repositories that they give you access to.
